Ace 2103/T helps CS2103/T students manage their tasks. It is optimized for CLI users so that each task can be managed faster by typing in commands.

Ace 2103/T is a **desktop app for managing task requirements of CS2103/T, optimized for use via Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Ace 2103/T can get your learning tasks managed faster than traditional GUI apps.
